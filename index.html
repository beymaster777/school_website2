 <h4 class="text-capitalize">Ray and Maria Stata Center</h4>
 <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Easily identifiable as "a Gehry" for its sculptural crinkled form, this complex includes research facilities, classrooms and a large auditorium, along with fitness facilities and a childcare centre.

  The American architect alternated the facade materials between shiny metal and red brick. Zigzagging metal canopies denote entrances along Vassar Street, and drum-shaped sections on the other side – facing an amphitheatre – are coloured yellow.
  
  MIT sued Gehry and the construction companies over failures in the design and negligence, but settled the lawsuit in 2007 after the issues were deemed resolved.

     <h4 class="text-capitalize">school dorms</h4>
     <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> Nicknamed The Sponge after its porous-looking facades, this halls of residence accommodates 350 rooms for freshman students. It was commissioned in 1999 when MIT ruled that all freshman must live on-campus, following an alcohol-related death of a student.

      The 10-storey structure by American architect Steven Holl is built from reinforced concrete, featuring cutouts from its cuboid form that create terraces and clad with pre-cast panels punctured by 5,538 two-foot-square windows.</h5>

      The Dewey Library is located on the east end of campus, inside the Hermann Building. It is the primary library for MIT’s Sloan School of Management, the Department of Economics, and the Department of Political Science. Renovated in 2009, the first floor has large windows with ample natural light and a variety of seating. The upper and lower floors house collections, group study rooms and quiet study areas. </h5>
